This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

Environment Configuration
To configure the GraphQL endpoint URL, follow these steps:

Create a `.env.local` file in the root folder of your project.

Add the following key-value pair to .env.local:

NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:3000

Replace `http://localhost:3000` with the actual URL of your GraphQL endpoint during local development.

For deployment on Vercel or other platforms:

In the remote deployment environment, update the `NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT` to point to your deployed GraphQL server, for example:

NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT=https://starwars-next-gql-ui.vercel.app/
